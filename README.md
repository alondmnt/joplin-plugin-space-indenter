# Space Indenter (Joplin Plugin)

This plugin exposes CodeMirror's relevant [settings](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#config) to Joplin users, which enable switching between tab indentation and space indentation. In addition, it can convert (if enabled in the settings) any existing tabs in notes to spaces, or vice versa (if you change your mind).

Thanks to [Rich Markdown](https://github.com/CalebJohn/joplin-rich-markdown) ([@CalebJohn](https://github.com/CalebJohn)), that heavily influenced this implementation.
