# Space Indenter (Joplin Plugin)

This plugin exposes CodeMirror's relevant [settings](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#config) to Joplin users, which enable switching between tab indentation and space indentation, and... that's it.

Thanks to [Rich Markdown](https://github.com/CalebJohn/joplin-rich-markdown) ([@CalebJohn](https://github.com/CalebJohn)), that heavily influenced this implementation.
