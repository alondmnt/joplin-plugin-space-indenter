- tab key behavior fix:
    - in any context, the tab key is always converted to spaces (based on the parameters in the plugin's settings)
    - when pressed anywhere on a list item, the tab key indents the line using spaces
- new toolbar button: reformat tabs, which converts all tabs in the current note to spaces (or changes spaces back to tabs, when the plugin is set to indent with tabs)
- new setting (off by default) to apply the above reformatting to any note when it's being loaded
